# ECC 2.0 GA Roadmap

This roadmap is the durable repo mirror for the Linear project:

<https://linear.app/ecctools/project/ecc-20-ga-harness-os-security-platform-de2a0ecace6f>

Linear issue creation is currently blocked by the workspace active issue limit,
so the live execution truth is split across:

- the Linear project description, status updates, and milestones;
- this repo document;
- merged PR evidence;
- handoffs under `~/.cluster-swarm/handoffs/`.

## Current Evidence

As of 2026-05-12:

- Public GitHub queues are clean across `everything-claude-code`,
  `agentshield`, `JARVIS`, `ECC-Tools`, and `ECC-website`.
- `npm run harness:audit -- --format json` reports 70/70 on current `main`.
- `npm run observability:ready` reports 14/14 readiness on current `main`.
- `docs/architecture/harness-adapter-compliance.md` maps Claude Code, Codex,
  OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini, Zed-adjacent, dmux, Orca, Superset, Ghast, and
  terminal-only support to install paths, verification commands, and risk
  notes.
- `npm run harness:adapters -- --check` validates that the public adapter
  matrix still matches the source data in
  `scripts/lib/harness-adapter-compliance.js`.
- `docs/releases/2.0.0-rc.1/publication-readiness.md` gates GitHub release,
  npm dist-tag, Claude plugin, Codex plugin, OpenCode package, billing, and
  announcement publication on fresh evidence fields.
- `docs/legacy-artifact-inventory.md` records that no `_legacy-documents-*`
  directories exist in the current checkout, inventories the two sibling
  workspace-level `_legacy-documents-*` repos as sanitized extraction sources,
  and classifies `legacy-command-shims/` as an opt-in archive/no-action
  surface.
- `docs/stale-pr-salvage-ledger.md` records stale PR salvage outcomes,
  skipped PRs, superseded work, and the remaining #1687 translator/manual
  review tail.
- AgentShield PR #53 reduced two context-rule false positives and closed the
  remaining AgentShield issues.
- AgentShield PR #55 added GitHub Action organization-policy enforcement with
  `policy` / `fail-on-policy` inputs, `policy-status` /
  `policy-violations` outputs, job-summary evidence, and policy violation
  annotations.
- AgentShield PR #56 added SARIF/code-scanning output for organization-policy
  violations as `agentshield-policy/*` results.
- AgentShield PR #57 added OSS, team, enterprise, regulated,
  high-risk-hooks/MCP, and CI-enforcement policy-pack presets plus
  `agentshield policy init --pack`.
- AgentShield PR #58 added MCP package provenance fields and report-level
  counts for npm vs git, pinned vs unpinned, known-good, and registry-backed
  supply-chain evidence.
- AgentShield PR #59 added self-contained HTML executive summaries with risk
  posture, critical/high priority findings, category exposure, README/API
  docs, built-CLI smoke validation, and 1,704-test coverage.
- AgentShield PR #60 added category-level built-in corpus benchmark output,
  a `readyForRegressionGate` signal, terminal `--corpus` category coverage,
  README/API docs, built-CLI smoke validation, and 1,705-test coverage.
- ECC PR #1778 recovered the useful stale #1413 network/homelab architect-agent
  concepts.
- ECC-Tools PR #26 added cost/token-risk predictive follow-ups for AI routing,
  Claude/model calls, usage limits, quota, and analysis-budget changes that lack
  budget, quota, rate-limit, or cost validation evidence.
- ECC-Tools PR #27 added the non-blocking `ECC Tools / PR Risk Taxonomy`
  check-run for Security Evidence, Harness Drift, Install Manifest Integrity,
  CI/CD Recommendation, Cost/Token Risk, and Agent Config Review buckets.
- ECC-Tools PR #28 added billing readiness audit checks for plan limits,
  entitlements, Marketplace plan shape, subscription source, seats, and
  overage metering.
- ECC-Tools PR #29 added deterministic Reference Set Validation signals for
  analyzer, skill, agent, command, and harness-guidance changes that lack eval,
  golden trace, benchmark, or reference-set evidence.
- ECC-Tools PR #30 capped follow-up generation to three new GitHub issues and
  one draft PR per run, then emits the remaining deterministic findings as a
  project sync backlog for Linear/status tracking without flooding trackers.
- ECC-Tools PR #31 added review follow-up signals to analysis completion
  comments for outstanding change requests, unresolved or outdated review
  threads, and review activity without an explicit approval.
- ECC-Tools PR #32 added CI failure-mode predictive follow-ups for workflow
  and test-runner changes that lack failure fixtures, captured logs,
  troubleshooting notes, dry-run evidence, or regression coverage.
- ECC-Tools PR #33 added harness-config quality predictive follow-ups for MCP,
  plugin, agent, hook, command, and harness config changes that lack harness
  audit, adapter matrix, cross-harness docs, or compatibility regression
  evidence.
- ECC-Tools PR #34 added skill-quality predictive follow-ups and a Skill
  Quality PR-risk bucket for skill, agent, command, and rule guidance changes
  that lack examples, validation, eval, or reference evidence.
- ECC-Tools PR #35 added RAG/evaluator predictive follow-ups and a
  RAG/Evaluator Evidence PR-risk bucket for retrieval, embedding, ranking, and
  evaluator changes that lack reference-set comparison, golden trace,
  benchmark, fixture, or eval-run evidence.
- ECC PR #1803 landed the contributor Quarkus handling branch after maintainer
  cleanup, current-`main` alignment, full local validation, and preservation of
  the author's removal of incomplete ja-JP and zh-CN Quarkus translations.

## Operating Rules

- Keep public PRs and issues below 20, with zero as the preferred release-lane
  target.
- Maintain 70/70 harness audit and 14/14 observability readiness after every
  GA-readiness batch.
- Do not publish release or social announcements until the GitHub release,
  npm/package state, billing state, and plugin submission surfaces are verified
  with fresh evidence.
- Do not treat closed stale PRs as discarded. Pair each cleanup batch with a
  salvage pass: inspect the closed diffs, port useful compatible work on
  maintainer-owned branches, and credit the source PR.
- Do not create new Linear issues until the active issue limit is cleared.

## Prompt-To-Artifact Execution Checklist

This table keeps the long operator prompt tied to concrete artifacts. A status
is not complete unless the evidence column exists and has been freshly verified.

## Execution Lanes And Tracking Contract

Until Linear issue capacity is cleared, this document is the durable execution
ledger and Linear receives project status updates only. When capacity is
available, each lane below should become a small set of Linear issues linked
back to the repo evidence and merge commits.

| Lane | Source of truth | Next tracked artifact | Update cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Queue hygiene and salvage | GitHub PR/issue state, salvage ledger | Append ledger entries for any future stale closures | Every cleanup batch |
| Release and publication | rc.1 release docs, publication readiness doc | Naming matrix and plugin submission/contact checklist | Before any tag |
| Harness OS core | Audit, adapter matrix, observability docs, `ecc2/` | HUD/session-control acceptance spec | Weekly until GA |
| Evaluation and RAG | Reference-set validation, harness audit, traces | Read-only evaluator/RAG prototype design | Before deep analyzer expansion |
| AgentShield enterprise | AgentShield PR evidence and roadmap notes | PDF-export decision or next enterprise signal | After value decision |
| ECC Tools app | ECC-Tools PR evidence, billing audit, risk taxonomy | Linear sync/deep-analyzer expansion slice | Next implementation batch |
| Linear progress | Linear project status updates and this mirror | Status update with queue/evidence/missing gates | Every significant merge batch |

The project status update should always include:

1. Current public PR and issue counts.
2. Merged evidence since the previous update.
3. Deferred or blocked items with the reason.
4. The next one or two implementation slices.
5. Any release or publication gate that is still not evidence-backed.

## Reference Pressure

The GA roadmap is informed by these reference surfaces:

- `stablyai/orca` and `superset-sh/superset` for worktree-native parallel agent
  UX, review loops, and workspace presets.
- `standardagents/dmux` and `aidenybai/ghast` for terminal/worktree
  multiplexing, session grouping, and lifecycle hooks.
- `jarrodwatts/claude-hud` for always-visible status, tool, agent, todo, and
  context telemetry.
- `stanford-iris-lab/meta-harness` and `greyhaven-ai/autocontext` for
  evaluation-driven harness improvement, traces, playbooks, and promotion
  loops.
- `NousResearch/hermes-agent` for operator shell, gateway, memory, skills, and
  multi-platform command patterns.
- `anthropics/claude-code`, active `sst/opencode` / `anomalyco/opencode`, Zed,
  Codex, Cursor, Gemini, and terminal-only workflows for adapter expectations.

The output of this reference work should be concrete ECC deltas, not a second
strategy memo.

## Milestones

### 1. GA Release, Naming, And Plugin Publication Readiness

Target: 2026-05-24

Acceptance:

- Naming matrix covers product name, npm package, Claude plugin, Codex plugin,
  OpenCode package, marketplace metadata, docs, and migration copy.
- GitHub release, npm dist-tag, plugin publication, and announcement gates are
  mapped to fresh command evidence.
- Release notes, migration guide, known issues, quickstart, X thread, LinkedIn
  post, and GitHub release copy are ready but not posted before release URLs
  exist.
- Plugin publication/contact paths for Claude and Codex are documented with
  owner, required artifacts, and submission status.

### 2. Harness Adapter Compliance Matrix And Scorecard Onramp

Target: 2026-05-31

Acceptance:

- Adapter matrix covers Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Gemini,
  Zed-adjacent surfaces, dmux, Orca, Superset, Ghast, and terminal-only use.
- Each adapter has supported assets, unsupported surfaces, install path,
  verification command, and risk notes.
- Harness audit remains 70/70 and gains a public onramp that explains how teams
  use the scorecard.
- Reference findings are converted into concrete adapter, observability, or
  operator-surface deltas.

### 3. Local Observability, HUD/Status, And Session Control Plane

Target: 2026-06-07

Acceptance:

- Observability readiness remains 14/14 and is backed by JSONL traces, status
  snapshots, risk ledger, and exportable handoff contracts.
- HUD/status model covers context, tool calls, active agents, todos, checks,
  cost, risk, and queue state.
- Worktree/session controls cover create, resume, status, stop, diff, PR,
  merge queue, and conflict queue.
- Linear/GitHub/handoff sync model is explicit enough for real-time progress
  tracking.

### 4. Self-Improving Harness Evaluation Loop

Target: 2026-06-10

Acceptance:

- Scenario specs, verifier contracts, traces, playbooks, and regression gates
  are documented and at least one read-only prototype exists.
- The loop separates observation, proposal, verification, and promotion.
- Team and individual setups can be scored and improved without blindly
  mutating configs.
- RAG/reference-set design covers vetted ECC patterns, team history, CI
  failures, diffs, review outcomes, and harness config quality.

### 5. AgentShield Enterprise Security Platform

Target: 2026-06-14

Acceptance:

- Formal policy schema exists for org baselines, exceptions, owners,
  expiration, severity, and audit trails.
- SARIF/code-scanning output is implemented and tested.
- GitHub Action policy gates expose organization policy status and violation
  counts for branch-protection and CI evidence.
- Policy packs are defined for OSS, team, enterprise, regulated, high-risk
  hooks/MCP, and CI enforcement.
- Supply-chain intelligence covers MCP package provenance and has an extension
  path for npm/pip reputation, CVEs, typosquats, and dependency risk.
- Prompt-injection corpus and regression benchmark are ready for continuous
  rule hardening with category-level coverage and regression-gate output.
- Enterprise reports include JSON plus self-contained HTML executive output
  with risk posture, priority findings, and category exposure.

### 6. ECC Tools Billing, Deep Analysis, PR Checks, And Linear Sync

Target: 2026-06-21

Acceptance:

- Native GitHub Marketplace billing announcement is backed by verified
  implementation and docs.
- Internal billing readiness audit covers plan limits, seats, entitlement
  mapping, Marketplace plan shape, subscription state, overage hooks, and
  failure modes.
- Deep analyzer covers diff patterns, CI/CD workflows, dependency/security
  surface, PR review behavior, failure history, harness config, skill quality,
  RAG/evaluator comparison, and reference-set validation.
- PR check suite taxonomy includes Security Evidence, Harness Drift, Install
  Manifest Integrity, CI/CD Recommendation, Cost/Token Risk, Reference Set
  Validation, RAG/Evaluator Evidence, Skill Quality, and Agent Config Review.
- Cost/token-risk predictive follow-ups flag AI routing, model-call, usage,
  quota, and budget changes when budget evidence is missing.
- Reference-set validation follow-ups flag analyzer, skill, agent, command, and
  harness-guidance changes that lack eval, golden trace, benchmark, or
  maintained reference-set evidence.
- RAG/evaluator follow-ups flag retrieval, embedding, ranking, and evaluator
  changes that lack reference-set comparison, golden trace, benchmark, fixture,
  or eval-run evidence.
- PR analysis comments summarize review follow-up signals for requested
  changes, unresolved or outdated review threads, and missing approvals.
- CI failure-mode predictive follow-ups flag workflow and test-runner changes
  that lack failure fixtures, captured logs, troubleshooting notes, dry-run
  evidence, or regression coverage.
- Harness-config quality predictive follow-ups flag MCP, plugin, agent, hook,
  command, and harness config changes that lack audit, adapter matrix,
  cross-harness doc, or compatibility regression evidence.
- Linear sync design maps findings to issues/status without flooding the
  workspace.
- Follow-up generation caps automatic GitHub object creation and keeps overflow
  findings in a copy-ready project sync backlog.

### 7. Legacy Audit And Stale-Work Salvage Closure

Target: 2026-06-15

Acceptance:

- Legacy directories and orphaned handoffs are inventoried.
- Each useful artifact is marked landed, Linear/project-tracked, salvage
  branch, or archive/no-action.
- Workspace-level legacy repos are mined only through sanitized maintainer
  branches; raw context, secrets, personal paths, local settings, and private
  drafts are never imported wholesale.
- Stale PR salvage policy stays in force: close stale/conflicted PRs first,
  record a salvage ledger item, then port useful compatible content on
  maintainer branches with attribution.
- #1687 localization leftovers are handled only by translator/manual review,
  not blind cherry-pick.

## Next Engineering Slices

1. Decide whether AgentShield PDF export adds value beyond the merged HTML
   executive report and corpus benchmark output.
2. Extend ECC Tools deep analysis and Linear/project sync without flooding the
   workspace.
